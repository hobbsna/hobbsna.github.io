        <section id = "synopsis">
        <p class="body_copy">The objective of this site is to provide a demonstration of the techniques covered to date in             SMAD 307: Interaction Design 1, while highlighting principles from previous SMAD courses. </p>
            
        <p class="body_copy">Everything aspect of the design was intentional and thought out. I like the look of parchment paper and decided to use that as the backdrop for my site. It reminds me of a treasure map. Purple is very important to me, as I am a JMU student, after all. I made the sight to look similarly to a portfolio site, but with a little less of the formality. I didn’t want to be like “bam!” Here’s all the things I can do! Hire me! While that sort of thing is useful on a resume, websites need to have a bit more personality – Hence the informal language throughout.</p> 
        
        <p class="body_copy">That being said, it’s time to get a bit technical. The navigation makes use of the float and :hover features of CSS. Text and images adjust with the screen size, demonstrating Responsive Web Design.  On tablet and desktop views, the footer uses a 3-column flexbox.  The resume actually has two very different views depending on whether you are using a phone or laptop. The laptop version adds margins and padding directly to the body element, while the phone version reduces extra space for improved readability on a small screen.</p>
           
        <p class="body_copy">Usability is important to me. That’s why I have multiple ways of doing the exact same thing! The nav bar and header are perhaps the most immediately obvious links, but other parts of the page work in a similar way. The logo provides an alternate way of getting back to the home page for desktop and tablet users.  Longer pages have the option to jump to the top of the page from the bottom. Last but not least, the Creative Media page works like Wikipedia – intro at the top with quick links to the various sections, for those who want to jump right in the middle of things.</p>
            
        <p class="body_copy">I definitely went a bit out of my comfort zone on this project. Some aspects, like website videos, I’ve actually dealt with before. The difference is largely in the way everything was implemented. For example, in the past when I’d needed an image, I would have just put one on the page, no questions asked. Now I actually take the time to provide captions and borders as needed.</p>
        <p class="body_copy">For me, the trickiest part has been deciding where to go with the project. It’s definitely tricky to plan ahead when you can’t see the road you’re supposed to follow. (Mostly because there isn’t really one!) It’s all one big off-road adventure!  I’ve learned to accept change when it’s necessary and avoid plowing ahead in the same direction when it’s clear there’s no future there. I also learned a good deal about creating “rules” for specific sections of the code, especially regarding links. A lot of the components function very similarly, but actually appear quite differently.</p>
