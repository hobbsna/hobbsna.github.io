        <!--Two paragraphs of info about me-->
        <p> Faith is very important to Nathan. He is a strongly devoted Christian and is heavily involved with InterVarsity at JMU. He participates in a 
            small group called Oozma Kappa and is a member of Discipleship Team.</p>
            
        <p> Nathan enjoys problem solving and coming up with creative ways to help the world. He is very fond of anything that involves interactions with others, 
            even though he is 50% introverted. Nathan loves getting the chance to encourage others and is always very loyal. It is theorized that he is at least partly a Hufflepuff,
            although there are definitely elements of Ravenclaw, and, on rare occasion, Gryffindor. </p>
            
        <p> In his spare time, Nathan enjoys reading, cooking, writing and playing music, hiking, and yoga. During breaks from work, Nathan often meditates.</p>
